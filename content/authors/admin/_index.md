Hi there! Iâ€™m Hani and I build cool products with AI. Iâ€™ve been working in the tech industry for over a decade, and Iâ€™m passionate about using artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems and building user experiance. 

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to lead teams of talented engineers and scientists, and together weâ€™ve built products that have impacted hundreds of millions of people. I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, intuitive solutions that make a difference.

Whether Iâ€™m working on a new recommendation ideas or developing a cutting-edge natural language processing model, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with AI and a better way to interact with it. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities to prototype new concepts and bring innovative products to life.
